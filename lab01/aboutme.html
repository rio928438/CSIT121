            <p>
                Hi my name is Carlos. I am an ARMY Vet using my GI Bill to come back to school and hopefully earn my degree.
                I haven't been in school for almost 10 years but I am motivated to succeed!

                I like gardening and try to by exotic plants that are typically hard to care for and see if I 
                can keep them alive. I also take alot of seeds from vegetables and fruits I buy and try to grow them. I currently have
                6 avocados growing, 2 mandarins, 2 pineapples and a flurry of mint and basil. I also like making mosaic art and am hoping 
                to own my own business one day.
