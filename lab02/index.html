        <p> Learning web page building has definitely sparked my interest in my classes. Professor Brown makes class
            exciting, by being very insightful and carefully giving instructions making sure that we are actually
            learning what we read and also showing examples of how things work and what they should look like in real
            time. Learning how to properly structure a web page using a wire frame, then implementing sections and links
            and also inserting hyperlinks. This has helped me understand how web pages should actually look and also how
            certain effects are created such as brackets, paragraphs headers and so on.
        
            <h3> What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                 <li>I learned how to use a wire frame which is like a simple blueprint that is hand drawn of the website I am creating.</li>
                 <li>I learned how to use headers, main, section, paragraphs, divisions, and also lists, brackets and hyperlinks</li>
                 <li>Another thing I learned was how the web works from HTTP Hyper-text  transfer protocols to HTML hypertext-Markup Language</li>
                </ol>
        </p>
        <p> Learning about all the cool HTML tags was very interesting and insightful. I learned from these sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Cheatsheet">Website Link </a>
                </li>
            (Moxilla Cheat Sheet)
            <li>Learning modules 1&2</li>
        </ul>
