            <p> This was a rather fast module that we learned but there are definitely some good points about it that I
                would like to dicuss. UI/UX. UI user interface focuses more on the visually pleasing ascpect of a
                website, vs UX User Experince focuses more on creating a comprehensive user journey. </p>

            <h3> What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>What is the URL of the website?<img src="GIAedu.png" alt="Gemstones Site" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;"></li>
                <div>https://www.gia.edu/<a href="https://www.gia.edu/">Click to Go </a></div>
                <li>What is the name of the website? </li>
                <div>Gemological institute of America</div>
                <li>Who is the site's target audience? </li>
                <div>People of all ages and demographics that are interested in gemstones and semi-precious gemstones.
                </div>
                <li>How is the site organized?</li>
                <div>The site is organized in a linear fashion</div>
                <li>Which CRAP Design Principle does the (site) use? Provide at least one example. </li>
                <div>Contrast first and foremost, as you can see through the webpage many instances and pictures of gems
                    brightly colored and eye-popping throughout. </div>
                <li>What is the Audit Score according to the Accessibility Checker?</li>
                <div>61....yikes It has mobility issues for the deaf and blind, good thing they wont be able to see or
                    hear them to figure it out!</div>
                <li>What is the site's effectiveness? Does it support users in completing actions accurately?</li>
                <div>Its definitely an effective site and furthermore it has an overlay that was instantiated probably
                    to aid the mobility defects it shows from the base score. It supports users in a variety of ways and
                    even gives an option to post a user's own site along to this site to help reach more people. </div>
                <li>What is the site's efficiency? Can users can perform tasks quickly?</li>
                <div>The site has a high efficiency, at least for those able to see and hear. the links on the site take
                    users quickly to each new section and there downt appear to be a load time for any page that I tried
                    to open within the site. Everything seemed aligned profeciently and items had great proximity to one
                    another.</div>
                <li>How is the engagement? Is it pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry/topic?</li>
                <div>The engagement is outstanding as it has various ways that the user can interact and learn. It has a
                    scrolling picture section that engages users in a variety of topics and it loads smoothly through
                    each iteration. It is visually pleasing and yet also boasts robust outlay for a more professional
                    setting.</div>
                <li>Make at least one recommendation to improve this website based on what you learned in this module.
                </li>
                <div>I would use different contrast settings to the extent of even giving a button that can switch the
                    site to two other viewing modes, one with warmer colors, and one as a nightmode and introduce
                    gemstones that are blacklight reactive especially for the haloween season coming up.</div>
            </ol>
