        <p> This was a rather fast module that we learned but there are definitely some good points about it that I
            would like to dicuss. UI/UX. UI user interface focuses more on the visually pleasing ascpect of a
            website, vs UX User Experince focuses more on creating a comprehensive user journey. </p>

        <h3> What I Learned</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>What is the URL of the website?<img src="GIAedu.png" alt="Gemstones Site"
                    style="float:right;width:500px;height:300px;">
                <div class="answer"> https://www.gia.edu/<a href="https://www.gia.edu/">Click to Go </a></div>
            </li>

            <li>What is the name of the website?<div class="answer">Gemological institute of America</div>
            </li>

            <li>Who is the site's target audience?<div class="answer">People of all ages and demographics that are
                    interested in gemstones and semi-precious gemstones.</div>
            </li>
           
            <li>How is the site organized?<div class="answer">The site is organized in a linear fashion</div>
            </li>
           
            <li>Which CRAP Design Principle does the (site) use? Provide at least one example.<div class="answer">
                    Contrast first and foremost, as you can see through the webpage many instances and pictures of gems
                    brightly colored and eye-popping throughout</div>
            </li>
           
            <li>What is the Audit Score according to the Accessibility Checker?<div class="answer">61....yikes It has
                    mobility issues for the deaf and blind, good thing they wont be able to see or
                    hear them to figure it out!</div>
            </li>
           
            <li>What is the site's effectiveness? Does it support users in completing actions accurately?<div
                    class="answer">Its definitely an effective site and furthermore it has an overlay that was
                    instantiated probably
                    to aid the mobility defects it shows from the base score. It supports users in a variety of ways and
                    even gives an option to post a user's own site along to this site to help reach more people.</div>
            </li>
           
            <li>What is the site's efficiency? Can users can perform tasks quickly?<div class="answer">The site has a
                    high efficiency, at least for those able to see and hear. the links on the site take
                    users quickly to each new section and there doesn't appear to be a load time for any page that I tried
                    to open within the site. Everything seemed aligned profeciently and items had great proximity to one
                    another.</div></li>
            
            <li>How is the engagement? Is it pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry/topic?<div class="answer">
                    The engagement is outstanding as it has various ways that the user can interact and learn. It has a
                    scrolling picture section that engages users in a variety of topics and it loads smoothly through
                    each iteration. It is visually pleasing and yet also boasts robust outlay for a more professional
                    setting.</div>
            </li>
           
            <li>Make at least one recommendation to improve this website based on what you learned in this module.<div
                    class="answer">I would use different contrast settings to the extent of even giving a button that
                    can switch the
                    site to two other viewing modes, one with warmer colors, and one as a nightmode and introduce
                    gemstones that are blacklight reactive especially for the haloween season coming up.</div>
            </li>
