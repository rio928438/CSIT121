        <p id="para1"> Learning web page building has definitely sparked my interest in my classes. Professor Brown
            makes class
            exciting, by being very insightful and carefully giving instructions making sure that we are actually
            learning what we read and also showing examples of how things work and what they should look like in real
            time. Learning how to properly structure a web page using a wire frame, then implementing sections and links
            and also inserting hyperlinks. This has helped me understand how web pages should actually look and also how
            certain effects are created such as brackets, paragraphs headers and so on. </p>

        <h3> What I Learned</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I learned how to use a wire frame which is like a simple blueprint that is hand drawn of the website I
                am creating.</li>
            <li class="highlight">I learned how to use headers, main, section, paragraphs, divisions, and also lists,
                brackets and
                hyperlinks</li>
            <li>Another thing I learned was how the web works from HTTP Hyper-text transfer protocols to HTML
                hypertext-Markup Language</li>
        </ol>

        <p> Learning about all the cool HTML tags was very interesting and insightful. I learned from these sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Cheatsheet">Moxilla HTML help </a>
            </li>

            <li>Learning modules 1&2</li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Lab 3</h4>
        <p>Learning about CSS started out seemingly easy enough, but then as I started to read more and more the
            confusion defintely started to set in. I know the examples are there to help and I tried applying them to
            my html page although I started to get errors here and there and had to re-read to understand exactly where
            to set my parameters or changes for what I was trying to accomplish. I also forgot about the order of
            precedence. I really like the inline method but I can see why it says to be weary of it in the module (in my
            own words). It actually says to use it with caution. I feel with the three styles in all comes down to how
            much detail you want and if you want to style 1 line, a paragraph, the whole page, 1 header, all the headers
            etc etc. So its important to use External, Internal, and inline for specific instances and also good
            practice to group multiple tags like I am going to do in a second for my headers as before I change it, they
            are all in different styles and it looks ridiulous lol. I did run difficulties and I refered back to the
            learning modules especially on class id, and also class selector. I wasn't sure how to id the id lol, and id
            the classes specifically I wanted to change. </p>

        <h5> What I Learned</h5>
        <ol>
            <li> I learned what the three different ways to CSS are : External, Internal, and Inline. Inline seems like
                the most tedious</li>
            <li class="highlight"> Another thing I learned was that if we want a very specific color then one of the
                index types have to
                be used ie Hex, RGB</li>
            <li>I was also happy to learn of the different styles Fonts, Positioning, Size, and Colors to name a few.
            </li>

        </ol>
