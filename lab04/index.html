            This is my main site, you will see three page links that you can click on that will take you to three
            pictures I like
            with a description and relative information about each picture. Each page has a link to return to this page
            so that you can then navigate to the other pages. All my pictures were taken by yours truly
            and so no copyright is needed for the pictures. The background Image is a darkened picture of one of my late
            Grandfather's Paintings. Enjoy!
