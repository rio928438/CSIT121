            The web of things is a fairy new concept. It is like a type of internet for smart devices. This can include
            but isn't limited to; Fridges, Microwaves, Dishwashers, Washer and Dryer, Lights, Smart Tvs. All these
            devices would be set to interact on a Hub. a Hub would be either an app on your phone or a system or program
            on a computer.

            Think about the Jetsons if youre old like me or like any episode of Rick and Morty! The Web
            of Things is modern way for devices to communicate with each other to provide a futuristic smart home
            experience. For example, say you come home from work, what if as soon as you walk in the door, the lights
            turn on, the stove turns on, some decaff coffee is made and so on. There are some many applications, and to
            flip it around think of the Morning. You wake up, sunlight colored light starts dim and within 25 minutes is
            fully bright, your coffee starts your toaster starts as well like back in the future, Doc Brown Styles!

            Below is a table that describes how the process starts. Example: from a bluetooth beacon on a device,
            accesses a URL, then access a web server, which then leads to the discovery of the application for that
            device in the HUB. this all just happened on a Toaster! This works not only for devices to be found across the web but also for devices found in the home. The smallest example of a full system would be lighting at home that would change with the seasons
