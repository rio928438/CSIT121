        <p id="para1"> I feel like the 3 questions we were asked to make a page about, were all pretty wrapped up in
            each
            other. I was reading an Article written by Dominque Benard, explaining that at this earlier stage it is more
            like the Intranet of things as everything requires its own app and not everything will connect to a hub, or
            the same hub as other devices. It starts with networked devices and then it goes through 4 processes to
            usability. These are : Access, Find, Share and Compose. To access a device has to have something acess it,
            like a car pulling up to a garage door and the sensor seeing it. To find it not only needs to be accessed
            but the device needs to understand that what it is sensing is it being found. To share, it needs certain
            protocols so it doesnt get lost in the web as a request without a return. To compose we put all these
            processes together and the device runs its functions! The following is taken directly from the Web of things
            Article I referenced earlier. 
            
            "Finally, once Things are on the Web (layer 1) where they can be found by
            humans and machines (layer 2) and their resources can be shared securely with others (layer 3), itâ€™s time to
            look at how to build large-scale, meaningful applications for the Web of Things. In other words, we need to
            understand the integration of data and services from heterogeneous Things into an immense ecosystem of web
            tools such as analytics software and mashup platforms"
