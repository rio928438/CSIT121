        <p id="para1">The web of things can help with certain tasks. Let me give you an example. In my home I like to
            grow microgreens. They are very healthy and make for great additions or side dishes to any meal. They can be
            somewhat tedious to grow however and if I cant alway be monitoring them they wont grow the best they
            possibly could. 
        </p>
        <p id="para2"> How can I use the WOT to help you didn't ask? I am still going to tell you! I have a mister
            that provides water, it mists a certain times of the day when watering plants is optimal. I have lights set
            up to different outputs for temperature and intensity "lumens". The lights are programmed through my hub to
            stay exactly on schedule. I have a fan that detects the amount of free oxygen in the air and will turn on to
            keep a breeze going to push out old air and plant emissions and pull in new oxygen for the plants to
            breathe. 
        </p>
        <p id="para3"> Lets think of this in a Much Larger operation now and think what if Farmers used the WOT to have
            all of their devices interact with each other and are able to act off each other from each devices sensors,
            helping grow produce at a large scale with minimal Human intervention. Welcome to the importance of the
            future, the importance of the Web of things!
