        <p id="para1"> I feel like the 3 questions we were asked to make a page about, were all pretty wrapped up in
            each
            other. I was reading an Article written by Dominque Benard, explaining that at this earlier stage it is more
            like the Intranet of things as everything requires its own app and not everything will connect to a hub, or
            the same hub as other devices. It starts with networked devices and then it goes through 4 processes to
            usability. These are : Access, Find, Share and Compose.
        </p>
        <p id="para2"> To access a device has to have something activate that process from it,
            like a car pulling up to a garage door and the sensor seeing it. To find it not only needs to be accessed
            but the device needs to understand that what it is sensing is it being found. To share, it needs certain
            protocols so it doesnt get lost in the web as a request without a return. To compose we put all these
            processes together and the device runs its functions!
        </p>
        <p id="para3"> All of these processees are happening either in an instant or close to it. Interestingly enough
            smaller scale systems could techniclly run without intervention from the internet or having a web connection
            at all. They could all communicate through buetooth and as long as they stay updated or the power is on and
            they are configured properly, they should all work without further human intervention.
